# Display RSS Feeds in Kaizala groups

Organizations use RSS feeds to complement their e-mail systems and improve the way they provide information to employees. Organizations can now leverage these feeds with the first line and mobile workers by sending them as announcements on Kaizala groups.

Five Use cases of RSS Feeds

1. Industry News from external sites
2. Company news from internal sites
3. Compete Information from external sites
4. Product Updates
5. Group specific feeds, Ex- Finance, Design and Tech 
6. Tips and Tricks, Ex- DIY, Sports and Photography

This sample will help, an admin user to add RSS feeds to Kaizala groups.  This card has 3 fields in chat card view- Card title(Ex- Business News), Image, Feed title ( Title of the News Feed). Tapping on the card will take you to news page within Kaizala.

7.  Save the Flow

RSS Feeds will be sent to the selected Kaizala group, each time flow is triggered by RSS Updates. 

Only the URL's whitelisted will be accessible within Kaizala, if not, the content would be directed to a browser.

To whitelist RSS feed URL add that URL in Package.json (as below)

``` json
"externalUrls": [
    { "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com" }
  ]	
} 
```

**Note**-You can only set one RSS feed URL in the Flow . To direct multiple feeds to same group, different Flows have to be created for each feed.
