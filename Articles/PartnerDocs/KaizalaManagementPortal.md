- IT Administrators
Use the portal to set up groups and manage users within these groups in a secure and compliant manner. For example, an administrator can add or remove users from a specific group, or remove a user from all organization groups, so that when an employee leaves, the person doesn't remain a member of organization groups, and doesn't have access to organization data.
- Developers
Use the portal to either create a new Kaizala Action, or customize a Kaizala Action. Developers can also add a new Connector to integrate their internal or external systems with Kaizala.
- Business User
Can view built-in reports, with real-time data updates, for Kaizala Actions shared in organization groups.
