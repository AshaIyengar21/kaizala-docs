# Groups in KAIZALA
In Kaizala, you can add or invite people to join the group even if they are not yet on Kaizala. As soon as they install Kaizala, they will see that they are already added to the group. 
<br>  Kaizala has three types of groups to cater to different types of organizational requirements - 

<br> **1. Flat Groups:** Flat groups are suited to usually small team groups/project team groups/leadership team groups and Work/Family team groups.

Some main properties of this kind of group includes –
<br>  ● Standard messaging groups where you can add thousands of users.
<br>  ● You can add users using phone numbers, saving a contact first is not mandatory.
<br>  ● You can create and assign Kaizala Actions like (Job, Survey, Poll, etc.) to any participant of the group 
<br>  ● Phone numbers of group members are only visible to admin; unless member is already in the contacts

<br>**2. Hierarchical Groups:** Most organizations in real world are not flat but hierarchical, and hence Kaizala provides a way to map your organizational hierarchy to chat platform.
<br>Unlike a flat group where all the information shared is visible to everyone in the group, in hierarchical group information flows from the top to the bottom. There exists a parent-child relationship between the groups. For example, when you add Group B to Group A, Group B becomes the sub-group of Group A and any message shared in Group A gets sent to group B also. Similarly, when group D is added to Group B,
<br> 1.	All messages sent in Group A are sent to both Group B and group D.
<br> 2.	All messages sent in Group B are sent to Group D.
<br>  3.	All messages sent in Group D, stay only in Group D.

<br>  Hierarchical groups are mainly used to share information with your entire organization or collect data from your organization. For example - 
<br>  (a) In a public-sector organization spread deep in a state, you can create geographical groups mapping to districts, mandals/constituencies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and state level organization units; 
<br>  (b)	You can create business groups headed by the parent group for CEO or HR, Finance, Operations Heads. Each of these can have regional &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;groups like North Sales Department, South Sales department, etc.;
<br>  (c)	College groups with departmental groups as child groups, having each year’s student batch as child groups.
<br>  (d)	Apartment community group with each building/tower representing a child group

Some main properties of this type of group include: 
<br>  ●	Groups can have direct members as well as subgroups as members.
<br> ●	Message sent at any level goes to all members of that group and down to all its child groups. Hence, chat is disabled in parents groups but all Kaizala Actions are enabled. So, members of parent groups can send Announcements or Surveys which will be sent to entire organization.
<br> ●	Any group member can create and assign Kaizala Actions like (Job, Survey, Poll, etc.) to anyone in the same group or below it.
<br>  ●	Child groups cannot send the message to a parent group or peer groups but they can present their views through Likes and Comments on each Kaizala Action sent to them.
<br>  ●	Bottom groups (leaf nodes) of the hierarchical groups are regular flat groups.

<br>  **3. Public Groups:** A Public Group in Kaizala is a unique group where members of the group can interact with the admin of the group on a one-to-one basis, but the interactions cannot be seen by other group members.
<br>  Public groups are usually preferred in scenarios like Govt agencies who want to connect with citizens; Enterprises can connect with customers; Enterprises can also create managed public group to connect with their vendors, suppliers, retailers, etc.; in this case, only pre-defined members can join the group

Some main properties of this kind of group include: <img align="right" src="Images/Public1.PNG">
<br>  ●    Admin can connect with any number of members and send and seek information
<br>  ●    These members cannot see each other or interact with each other.
<br>  ●    These members can communicate with admin only through admin defined custom cards like giving Feedback, Share your requirement, etc.
<br>  ●    Members can subscribe to a public group using a link.
