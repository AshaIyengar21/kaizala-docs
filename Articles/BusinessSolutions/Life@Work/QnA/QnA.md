# Get structured answers to your questions from co-workers

Elevating employee engagement is essential for the success of any organization-whether itâ€™s a small startup or large corporation that operates across multiple locations. It can be challenging for leaders and managers to know how employees are feeling about company policies, projects, jobs, and assigned tasks.

With the increase in mobile workforce conducting such QnA sessions with managers, on the go, can be even more difficult. On resorting to QnA session on mobile chat, the replies to questions can interrupt the flow and end-user may miss out on information

With QnA card, users can ask questions to managers and rest of the community view all the replies in a structured format.

This is a simple card with a creation view, that allows the user to submit a question, a chart card view for users to see the latest comment and a summary view that allows users to view and participate in the discussion.
