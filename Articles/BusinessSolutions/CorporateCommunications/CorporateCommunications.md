# Corporate communications

Effective communication is a core pillar for employee engagement. With an increasing mobile workforce and first line workers, it is important for an organization to build an inclusive network of connected employees and create a channel for real-time communication.

Kaizala enables organizations to build this network of connected employees by bringing in first line worker into digital fold of the organization. Organizations can send corporate news, product information and critical announcements building an inclusive organization.

To simplify the process of communication and leverage the current investments made in communication channels, organizations can use custom actions to display internet and intranet feeds in Kaizala groups.
