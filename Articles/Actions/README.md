# Kaizala Actions

## Overview
Kaizala Actions are basic 'units of work' that help users get work done within a conversation context inside Kaizala. Some of these Actions like Job, Survey, Poll, etc. are 
shipped out-of-the-box and provide scoped functionality. These Actions can be discovered within the Kaizala app and can be invoked in a conversation context from the Action 
Palette. 

[Kaizala Management Portal](https://manage.kaiza.la) is the gateway for all development, testing and publishing of new Kaizala Actions.

All Actions that are published to a set of users can be invoked by them on any groups that Action had been added to. Custom Actions can only be added to organization groups.

A Kaizala Action currently contains four different views that can be defined:

* A creation view when an Action is invoked from the palette
* A card view that appears on the chat canvas when an instance of the Action is sent
* A responder view for users to respond to the Kaizala Action
* A summary view to view aggregated responses

You can create new Kaizala Actions that leverage Kaizalaâ€™s people network and mobile capabilities to create compelling experiences in the following ways:

* **Design a new Kaizala Action through the Kaizala Management Portal** - You can design a custom Kaizala Action through the Action Designer interface by building on the existing Action templates.
