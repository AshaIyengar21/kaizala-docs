# Kaizala Actions

## Overview
Kaizala Actions are basic 'units of work' that help users get work done within a conversation context inside Kaizala. Some of these Actions like Job, Survey, Poll, etc. are shipped out-of-the-box and provide scoped functionality. These Actions can be discovered within the Kaizala app and can be invoked in a conversation context from the Action Palette.

We understand that needs of every organization vary and they would require functionalities that would be very different from the needs of any other organization. Hence Kaizala enable development of Kaizala Actions by 3rd Party developers. These custom Actions can be deployed to a select set of groups, even within an organization. All Actions that are published to a set of users can be invoked by them on any groups that Action had been added to. 

> **Note:** Custom Actions can only be added to organization groups.

> **Note :** [Kaizala Management Portal](https://manage.kaiza.la) is the gateway for all development, testing and publishing of new Kaizala Actions.

## Understanding Kaizala Action

A Kaizala Action currently contains four different views that can be defined:

* A creation view when an Action is invoked from the palette
* A card view that appears on the chat canvas when an instance of the Action is sent
* A responder view for users to respond to the Kaizala Action
* A summary view to view aggregated responses

You can create new Kaizala Actions that leverage Kaizalaâ€™s people network and mobile capabilities to create compelling experiences in the following ways:

* **Design a new Kaizala Action through the Kaizala Management Portal** - You can design a custom Kaizala Action through the Action Designer interface by building on the existing Action templates.

* **Develop a new Kaizala Action package** - You can create complex new Kaizala Actions that provide custom functionality using web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Follow the links below to learn about various stages of developement of a Kaizala Action.
